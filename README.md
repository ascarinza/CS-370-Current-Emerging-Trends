**•	Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

For the Treasure Hunt Project, the provided code was used to create the environment, manage the rules, and display output. The methods provided were used to get the agent to interact with the environment. Other factors such as the neural network structure were also given in the starter code. 
The code that I wrote controlled the learning aspect of the agent. The logic behind how the agent learned was created uses a loop that ran for each episode in an epoch. This episodic loop started by assigning a location for the robot, using Q-Values via exploration and exploitation to choose a move, and then evaluating the reward of the move. This iterative process was responsible for shaping the agent and getting it to reach the end with a high success rate. Variables such as the number of epochs, episodes, learning rate, and loss levels were optimized to create efficient learning.

**o	What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**

Computer scientists are responsible for using existing technologies and creating new methods to solve problems. Creating new methods could be combining existing technologies together to create a new functionality or creating a new too. The issues computer scientists deal with will be translated into code so that the solution can be developed and run by a computer system. As new technologies such as AI have the potential to solve large world problems, the ability to solve these problems as a computer scientist is important. 

**o	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

As a computer scientist, approaching a problem starts by first understanding the question. Only after you truly understand the questions and what is being asked of you can you begin to look for ways to try and solve the problem. Once I understand the question, I reflect and see if I can find any similarities to the existing problem and problems I have solved in the past. Sometimes there are patterns in problems, and this can help gain familiarity with how the solution could look. After an approach is made, either via past work, or new ideas, I research the needed tools and information I will need when creating the solution. After I can get the needed information to start, I begin by drawing a plan and working through it. After the first iteration, I look back at the question so ensure I have answered the correct question and make any needed adjustments. 

**o	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

Ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization start from the issue they are looking to solve. Creating a plan that aligns to their interests and meets their given criteria is the mission of the developers. While it is important to stay aligned to the company, the developers are the last line of defense when it comes to an organization creating an unethical project that could negatively affect the end users. It is important that as a developer, I have ethical guidelines that can help guide me when ethical conflicts arise.
